1. The addresses for the functions main and recur and the static variable stuff can be found in the Symbol Table. The others are not known until runtime.

2. Overall File Header- Contains the file format and architecture it is built for, as well as the start address.

Program Header- Information needed to prepare for execution.

Dynamic Section- Information for dynamic linking.

Sections- For locating any section of the object file by virtual or logical memory addressing or file offset.

Symbol Table- For locating the program's symbolic definitions and references.


3. The stack is growing down.

4. 0x7ffdad4db78c - 0x7ffdad4db75c = 3 * 16 = 48 bytes.

5. The heap contains the user variables buf1 and buf2. It is growing up from 0x1186010.

6. 0x1186080 - 0x1186010 = 7 * 16 = 112. The malloc()ed variables only requested 100 bytes each, so there is an additional 12 byte section between them.
